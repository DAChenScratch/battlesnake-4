## Preparing for Battle
Everything you need to know before attending BattleSnake.

#### Coming Prepared

Your team __will be writing code__, come prepared to do so.

You should also have the following:
* Laptop with Git, Web Language of choice (Node, Python, Ruby, Java, Go, etc), and a Text Editor (Sublime Text, Vim, etc)
* A [GitHub](http://github.com) account
* A free [Heroku](http://heroku.com) account

We strongly recommend familiarizing yourself with [Heroku](http://heroku.com) before hand. Deploying with [Heroku](http://heroku.com) will maximize time spent developing your AI (and not messing around with servers). All provided code samples and example AIs will be ready-to-deploy to Heroku.
