# BattleSnake Game Rules

*Work in progress.*

<br>

## Objective

BattleSnake is an adaptation of the classic video game "Snake" where you control a snake as it move around the play field.  Each round pits up to X snakes against eachother, and the goal is to be the last snake left alive at the end of the round.

## How do you die?

* Running into another snake.
* Running into your own body.
* Running into the walls of the play field.
* Head to head collisions result in the death of both snakes.

## Snake Sacrifices

* To discourage cowardly snakes, the Snake Goddess demands constant snakerifices.
* If no snake has died in 100 turns, the shortest snake in the game will automatically be sacrificed.
* If two or more snakes are tied for last place, all of them will be sacrificed.

## How to avoid sacrifice?

* To avoid being sacrificed, you must ensure that your snake is well fed.
* Food will spawn randomly around the board.
* Each piece of food eaten will increase the length of your snake by 1.
* Killing another snake by cutting them off with your body will increase the length of your own snake.
* Kills net you HALF of the victims length, rounded down.

## Sportsmanship

* There are no rules.
